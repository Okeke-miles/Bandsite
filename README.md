# Bandsite
In this project, I built a website for a music band. While building, I simulated a professional work environment. We were given mockups of the visual requirements of the website. I ensured I replicated all the visual features to the minutest detail. I used a pseudo kanban board to list tasks and tick them off based on completion.

TOOLS I used Sass for the styling.
